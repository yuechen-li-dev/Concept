## Section 1–4: Thesis, Design Laws, Identity, Naming

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Language thesis and design laws | ✅ | Embodied in AGENTS.md and phase design docs |
| C++-lineage visual shape | ✅ | Return-type-first declarations, braces, semicolons |
| `module` declaration | ✅ | Required at top of every source file, name-checked |
| No textual preprocessor | ✅ | No `#define`, no `#include` anywhere in the pipeline |
| Keyword/language name overlap (`concept`) | ✅ | Intentional, working |

---

## Section 5–6: Visual Shape and Source Files

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| C-family brace/semicolon syntax | ✅ | |
| `struct` declarations | ✅ | Fields, struct literals, field access, field address-of |
| `enum` declarations | ✅ | Payload enums with typed fields, unit variants |
| `template` keyword | ✅ | Phase 8 — `template<T>` unconstrained and `template<T: Concept<T>>` constrained |
| `concept` keyword | ✅ | Phase 8 — method-bearing and marker forms |
| `interface` keyword | 🔶 | Phase 14 closed — parser accepts `interface` signature blocks; P14 v0 preserves declarations in HIR, validates non-empty requirement signatures, validates `impl Interface<Type>` conformance, preserves dyn parameter types, supports concrete-to-dyn call coercion, represents dyn method calls explicitly in HIR/MIR, lowers the borrowed dyn subset to C vtables/fat refs, and has examples/fixtures/backend assertions for that subset |
| `impl` blocks | ✅ | Phase 8 — `impl Concept<Type>`, `unsafe impl`, `impl Drop<T>`; Phase 14 closed — separate interface impl conformance plus selected impl vtable/wrapper emission for dyn dispatch |
| `operator` overloading | ❌ | PoC3 §25 — not in any phase plan yet |
| `move` keyword | ✅ | Phase 10 — explicit move expression, use-after-move diagnosed |
| `try` keyword | ✅ | Phase 5 — propagates `Result` error arm |
| `unsafe` blocks and functions | ✅ | Phase 6 — quarantined, raw pointer deref and pointer arith require unsafe |
| Real module system (no headers) | 🔶 | Phase 16 closed for compilation-unit modules v0: harness/driver-supplied multi-file source sets, module declaration table, resolved import graph, module-aware HIR, per-module top-level symbol tables, qualified cross-module functions/types, imported repr(C) metadata, and multi-source MIR/backend/run in one generated C unit; packages, filesystem lookup, visibility, separate compilation, and linker driving remain deferred |
| `import` declarations | ✅ | Phase 16 v0 imports are implemented for qualified access only: parser/AST preservation, ordering diagnostic `CON0273`, resolved graph edges, `CON0271` unknown import, `CON0277` duplicate import, `CON0272` import cycle, qualified function calls, qualified type references, and no unqualified name injection |
| Multi-file fixture support | ✅ | Phase 16 supports hermetic `.conception` source sets with `=== file: <virtual-path> ===` sections and virtual-path preservation |
| Module declaration table | ✅ | Stable `ModuleId` records, source order, virtual paths, duplicate module detection `CON0270`, and missing module declaration `CON0276` |
| Import graph resolution | ✅ | Raw imports are preserved and resolved to module IDs before semantic lowering; unknown, duplicate, and cyclic imports are diagnosed |
| HIR module records | ✅ | HIR stores module records, resolved imports, and per-item module ownership metadata |
| Per-module symbol tables | ✅ | Ordinary duplicate top-level names are scoped per module; same item names across modules are accepted when referenced with qualification |
| Cross-module qualified function calls | ✅ | `Module.Function(...)` resolves for current/imported modules and lowers/runs through MIR/backend |
| Cross-module qualified type references | ✅ | `Module.Type` resolves in type positions for imported structs/enums and current modules |
| Imported repr(C) metadata across modules | ✅ | Imported repr(C) structs remain visible to semantic C ABI validation; imported non-repr structs remain rejected at C ABI boundaries |
| Multi-source backend/run lowering | ✅ | Supported multi-source programs lower to MIR and emit one generated C unit in v0 |
| Backend module name collision hardening | ✅ | Ordinary same-name functions and structs across modules receive collision-safe generated C names; `export "C"` symbols remain exact/unmangled |
| Phase 16 examples/fixtures | ✅ | `examples/phase16/` documents representative virtual-file examples; `language/phase16-imports/` contains 73 fixtures including closeout coverage |
| Import aliases | ❌ | Deferred; no alias syntax in v0 |
| Wildcard imports | ❌ | Deferred; wildcard imports are rejected |
| Re-exports | ❌ | Deferred; imports do not create a public export surface |
| Unqualified imported names | ❌ | Deferred by design; imports do not inject declarations into local scope |
| Module visibility (`public`/`private`) | ❌ | Deferred; all imported top-level declarations are accessible by qualified name in v0 |
| Package manager / cross-package dependencies | ❌ | Deferred; modules are compilation-unit boundaries, not packages |
| Filesystem import search / path-to-file mapping | ❌ | Deferred; source files are supplied by harness/driver rather than discovered from import paths |
| Module spanning multiple files | ❌ | Deferred; each v0 source declares exactly one module and one module does not span files |
| Multiple modules per file | ❌ | Deferred/rejected; multiple `module` declarations use existing parser diagnostic `CON0005` |
| Separate object files / linker driver / incremental compilation | ❌ | Deferred; Phase 16 emits one generated C unit for v0 |
| Conditional compilation `when target.*` | 🔶 | `target.isLittleEndian`, `target.pointerSize` available as comptime queries; full `when target.os` structured conditional compilation not implemented |

---

## Section 7–8: Standard Library Layers and Profiles

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `Core` (freestanding) library layer | ❌ | No stdlib shipped yet; compiler-intrinsic types only |
| `Alloc` library layer | ❌ | Arena types are compiler-intrinsic, not a shipped library |
| `Runtime` layer | ❌ | |
| `OS` layer | ❌ | |
| `Full` hosted layer | ❌ | |
| `profile freestanding` declaration | ❌ | Parser/HIR don't have profile declarations yet |
| `profile kernel` declaration | ❌ | |
| Profile-driven effect defaults | ❌ | Effects are function-level only; no profile defaults |

---

## Section 9: Effects

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `noalloc` effect annotation | ✅ | Phase 12 — function-level, checked transitively at direct call edges |
| `alloc` effect annotation | ✅ | Phase 12 — functions calling `Arena.alloc` carry alloc effect |
| Effect-tagged function types | ✅ | `noalloc` is part of function's HIR representation |
| Transitive effect checking | 🔶 | Direct call-edge `noalloc` violations caught; full transitive closure across all effect types not yet complete |
| `nothrow` effect | ❌ | |
| `nopanic` effect | ❌ | |
| `nostackgrow` effect | ❌ | |
| `nohost` / `freestanding` effect | ❌ | |
| `interrupt` effect | ❌ | |
| `pure` effect | ❌ | |
| `cold` / `hot` hints | ❌ | |
| Effects visible in MIR | ✅ | Allocation effect on functions is MIR-level data |
| Effect violations caught pre-codegen | ✅ | `noalloc` violations are HIR/MIR-stage errors |

---

## Section 10: Memory Model

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Use-before-initialization rejected | ✅ | Phase 10 — MIR storage-state analysis, `Uninitialized` state diagnosed |
| Use-after-move rejected | ✅ | Phase 10 — `Moved` storage state diagnosed |
| Moved values not double-dropped | ✅ | Phase 10 — moved locals skipped in drop cleanup |
| `must_use` checking | ✅ | Phase 5 — `Result` is must_use by default; `discard` keyword for intentional discard |
| Raw pointer deref requires `unsafe` | ✅ | Phase 6 |
| Allocation effects enforced for `noalloc` | ✅ | Phase 12 |
| Destructor/drop order deterministic | ✅ | Phase 10 — reverse initialization order in MIR |
| `immovable` types | ❌ | PoC3 §15 — not in any phase plan yet |
| `moved_state` declaration on structs | ❌ | PoC3 §14 — not yet |
| Null references rejected | ❌ | No reference type system yet; no nullable analysis |
| `nullable` access requires checking | ❌ | |

---

## Section 11: Values, References, and Pointers

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Value types by default | ✅ | Structs and enums are values |
| `T&` non-null read borrow | 🔶 | Reference types parsed and type-checked; no full lifetime/alias checking |
| `mut T&` mutable borrow | 🔶 | Parsed and checked for explicit `mut` requirement |
| `T*` raw nullable pointer | ✅ | Phase 6 — pointer types, deref in unsafe |
| `own T*` owning pointer | ❌ | Parsed by phase 6 but no ownership semantic distinction from `T*` yet |
| Pointer arithmetic requires `unsafe` | ✅ | Phase 6 |
| `span<T>` type | ❌ | Mentioned in PoC3 §11.4; not implemented |
| Copy vs non-copy semantics | ✅ | Phase 10 — `Copy` marker concept, implicit copy for scalars/Copy structs, error for non-Copy |
| Explicit `move` expression | ✅ | Phase 10 |

---

## Section 12: No Region Lifetimes

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| No region lifetime system in core | ✅ | Explicitly not implemented per PoC3 §12 — correct by design |
| Explicit allocator passing | ✅ | Phase 12 — `Arena*` passed explicitly, no ambient heap |
| Index-based arena handles | 🔶 | `Arena.alloc<T>` returns raw value; typed `Id<T>` / `Store<T, Id>` pattern deferred from Phase 12 |
| Deterministic arena destruction | ✅ | Phase 12 — `Arena.destroy`, `Arena.reset` implemented |

---

## Section 13: Initialization

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Uninitialized variables rejected in safe code | ✅ | Phase 10 — MIR `Uninitialized` state |
| `ManualInit<T>` for low-level uninitialized storage | ✅ | Phase 10 — `ManualInit<T>`, `unsafe manualAssumeInit(move slot)` |
| Partial initialization tracked in MIR | ✅ | Phase 10 — partial direct-field state tracked |
| Only initialized fields dropped | ✅ | Phase 10 |

> **Implementation difference:** PoC3 §13 sketches `MaybeUninit<T>` as the type name. Phase 10 uses `ManualInit<T>` as the canonical Concept term. `MaybeUninit<T>` is treated as compatibility terminology only.

---

## Section 14–15: Move Semantics and Immovable Types

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Explicit `move` expression | ✅ | Phase 10 |
| Use-after-move is a compile error | ✅ | Phase 10 |
| Moved values are not dropped | ✅ | Phase 10 |
| `moved_state` declaration | ❌ | PoC3 §14 — not yet |
| `immovable` struct qualifier | ❌ | PoC3 §15 — not yet |

---

## Section 16: Drop and RAII

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `impl Drop<T>` intrinsic concept | ✅ | Phase 10 — `Drop` is compiler-intrinsic, `impl Drop<T>` with single `void drop(mut T&)` requirement |
| Drop inserted at MIR level | ✅ | Phase 10 — explicit drop points in MIR cleanup |
| Locals drop in reverse initialization order | ✅ | Phase 10 |
| Fields drop in reverse declaration order | 🔶 | Drop of struct fields via `Drop<T>.drop` called; field-level reverse order partially implemented |
| Moved values not dropped | ✅ | Phase 10 |
| Drop functions may not be comptime | ✅ | Phase 10 — diagnosed as error |
| `discard` keyword for intentional drop of must_use | ✅ | Phase 5 |

> **Implementation difference:** PoC3 §16 uses C++ `~Destructor()` syntax as background, but Concept uses `impl Drop<T>` as an intrinsic concept. This is already PoC3-correct — the C++ syntax is only mentioned as contrast.

---

## Section 17: Errors

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `Result<T, E>` as the error type | ✅ | Phase 5 — compiler-intrinsic type |
| `try` propagation | ✅ | Phase 5 |
| `Result<E>` sugar for `Result<void, E>` | 🔶 | HIR represents it; `return;` from `Result<E>` function partially supported |
| `must_use` on `Result` by default | ✅ | Phase 5 |
| `discard` for intentional error discard | ✅ | Phase 5 |
| Generalizable `must_use` on any type | 🔶 | `must_use` on enums implemented; arbitrary `must_use` on functions deferred |
| Nominal error types preferred | ✅ | Payload enums as error types work fully |
| `panic` / `assert` | ✅ | Phase 17 closed for statement-position `panic("reason")` and `assert(condition, "reason")`: AST/HIR/MIR/backend lowering, bool-only assert conditions, mandatory non-blank runtime failure reasons (`CON0280`-`CON0285`), deterministic exit code 101, backend-owned `cpt_panic`, helper de-duplication, machine `Result(machine)`-before-completion trap migration, and no Core.Test/test-runner dependency for runtime assertions |
| Mandatory runtime failure reasons | ✅ | Missing/wrong panic reasons use `CON0280`, missing/wrong assert reasons use `CON0281`, and empty/whitespace reasons use shared validation with `CON0282` |
| Runtime failure lowering substrate | ✅ | Panic/assert HIR and MIR lower to C through a shared backend helper; failing assert emits a conditional `cpt_panic` call, explicit panic emits a direct call, and migrated machine traps emit the same helper call |
| Deterministic runtime failure exit code | ✅ | Explicit panic, false runtime assert, and machine result-before-completion all exit 101 in hosted C v0 |
| Backend `cpt_panic` helper | ✅ | Backend-owned helper prints `panic: %s\n` to stderr, exits 101, is emitted once per generated C unit when needed, and is shared across panic/assert/migrated traps |
| Core.Test Assert doctrine alignment | ✅ | `Assert.True`/`Assert.False` require bool conditions and non-blank reasons and are classified internally as assertion/invariant failures; `Expect.*` remains expectation-style |
| `panic_handler` for freestanding | ❌ | |
| Panic modes (`abort`, `halt`, `unwind`, `custom`) | ❌ | |

---

## Section 18–19: Payload Enums and Pattern Matching

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Payload enum declarations | ✅ | Phase 1/5 — typed payload fields per variant |
| Unit enum variants | ✅ | |
| `match` expression | ✅ | Phase 2/5 — exhaustive by default |
| Exhaustiveness checking | ✅ | All variants must be covered or `_` wildcard used |
| Payload binding in match arms | ✅ | Phase 5 |
| Wildcard `_` arm | ✅ | |
| Literal matching in match | ✅ | Phase 2 — integer/bool literals |
| Match guards (`when`) | ❌ | PoC3 §19 — guard syntax not yet parsed |
| Struct destructuring in match | ❌ | |
| Binding by reference in match arms | ❌ | |
| `match` as expression (returns value) | 🔶 | `match` can appear in expression position; full expression-match with mixed arm types partially supported |

---

## Section 20–23: Concepts, Generics, Marker Concepts, Implementations

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `concept Foo<T> { ... }` declaration | ✅ | Phase 8 — method-bearing concepts with required signatures |
| `template<T>` unconstrained generics | ✅ | Phase 8 — monomorphized at instantiation |
| `template<T: Concept<T>>` constrained generics | ✅ | Phase 8 — constraint checked at call site |
| `&&` compound constraints | 🔶 | Parsed; checking of multi-constraint combinations partially implemented |
| Generic type inference | ✅ | Phase 8 — infers T from argument types |
| `impl Concept<Type>` blocks | ✅ | Phase 8 — with required method implementations verified |
| `impl Drop<T>` | ✅ | Phase 10 — compiler-intrinsic |
| `marker concept Foo<T>` | ✅ | Phase 8 — no methods, no runtime representation |
| `unsafe marker concept Foo<T>` | ✅ | Phase 8 — requires `unsafe impl` |
| `unsafe impl` for unsafe marker concepts | ✅ | Phase 8 — compiler enforces bidirectional unsafe/safe consistency |
| Safe marker concept rejects `unsafe impl` | ✅ | Phase 8 — CON0108 diagnostic |
| Built-in marker concepts (`Copy`, `Move`, `Trivial`, `Relocatable`, `Pod`) | ✅ | Phase 8 — declared as known marker kinds |
| `derive Copy` etc. | ❌ | Marker concepts declared and usable; derive shorthand not implemented |
| Negative concepts `template<T: !Concept<T>>` | ❌ | PoC3 §22 — not yet |
| Orphan rule for impl coherence | ❌ | Phase 8 impls work in single-module scope; multi-module coherence deferred |
| `bridge` modules | ❌ | PoC3 §23.2 — deferred to multi-module work |
| No SFINAE | ✅ | By design — constraint violations diagnosed at call site |
| No `anytype` style duck typing as primary model | ✅ | By design |

---

## Section 24: Interfaces and Dynamic Dispatch

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `interface Foo { ... }` declaration | 🔶 | Phase 14 closed — P14 v0 preserves top-level interface declarations, requirement signatures, spans, attributes, duplicate/overload checks, duplicate parameter checks, empty-interface rejection, interface-type runtime-use rejection, interface impl conformance, dyn parameter type surfaces, dyn coercion HIR/MIR, dyn method-call HIR/MIR, C backend vtable/fat-ref lowering for used borrowed dyn interfaces, and non-emission for unused interface/impl declarations |
| `impl Interface<Type>` | 🔶 | Phase 14 closed — P14 v0 recognizes interface impls as HIR entities separate from concept impls, checks missing/extra/duplicate methods, receiver convention, return type, and parameter types, uses matching `(interface, concrete type)` impls for dyn coercion lookup, emits selected wrapper thunks plus static vtable constants, and pins wrapper C shape plus vtable reuse |
| `dyn Foo&` dynamic dispatch | 🔶 | Phase 14 closed — P14 v0 implements borrowed `dyn Interface&` / `mut dyn Interface&` type syntax, TypeStore/HIR preservation for function parameters, call-boundary concrete-to-dyn coercion from addressable places with matching interface impls, dyn method calls resolved to interface requirement slots in HIR/MIR, explicit C fat-reference construction, indirect vtable calls, executable dispatch fixtures, examples, and mutability hardening fixtures; owning dyn boxes, dyn returns/fields/locals, RTTI, dynamic cast, interface inheritance, and mutation-through-dyn hardening remain unimplemented |
| `interface` vs `concept` distinction | ✅ | Phase 14 doctrine: concept is static proof/generic constraint; interface is runtime contract represented in HIR and lowered to explicit vtables only through `dyn`; dyn is explicit borrowed dynamic reference |

---

## Section 25: Operator Overloading

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Operator overloading | ❌ | Not in any phase plan yet |

---

## Section 26–27: Allocation and Index-Based Arenas

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Explicit allocator passing (no ambient heap) | ✅ | Phase 12 — `Arena*` parameter pattern |
| `Arena.alloc<T>(arena)` | ✅ | Phase 12 — compiler-intrinsic, type-checked, effect-checked |
| `Arena.reset(arena)` | ✅ | Phase 12 |
| `Arena.destroy(arena)` | ✅ | Phase 12 |
| `Arena.alloc` rejected in `noalloc` context | ✅ | Phase 12 |
| `Arena.alloc` rejected in `comptime` | ✅ | Phase 12 — CON0201 |
| `Arena.alloc` of Drop types | 🔶 | Drop-hardened arena restrictions implemented; Drop-in-arena full semantics deferred from Phase 12 |
| `Arena.create` (owned arena construction) | ❌ | Deferred from Phase 12 |
| `AllocatorLike<T>` concept | ❌ | Phase 12 uses compiler-intrinsic `Arena`/`Allocator` types; generic allocator concept deferred |
| `Id<T>` with index + generation | ❌ | Deferred from Phase 12 |
| Generic `Store<T, Id>` | ❌ | Deferred from Phase 12 |
| Named store IDs | ❌ | Deferred from Phase 12 |
| Generation counters | ❌ | Deferred from Phase 12 |
| C arena helper ABI | ✅ | Phase 12 — stable C helper function signatures emitted |

> **Implementation difference:** PoC3 §27 envisions `Arena` and `Allocator` as library types implementing a concept. Phase 12 implements them as compiler-intrinsic types with special-cased semantics. This is an explicit temporary deviation — the intrinsic path proves the semantics before the generic-concept path is designed.

---

## Section 28: Unsafe

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `unsafe { }` blocks | ✅ | Phase 6 |
| `unsafe fn` declarations | ✅ | Phase 6 |
| Raw pointer dereference requires unsafe | ✅ | Phase 6 |
| Pointer arithmetic requires unsafe | ✅ | Phase 6 |
| `unsafe impl` for unsafe marker concepts | ✅ | Phase 8 |
| Type checking not disabled inside unsafe | ✅ | All normal type rules still apply inside unsafe |
| `manualAssumeInit` requires unsafe | ✅ | Phase 10 |

---

## Section 29: Volatile, Atomics, Barriers, Address Spaces

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `volatileLoad<T>` / `volatileStore<T>` operations | ❌ | Not yet |
| Atomic operations (`atomicStore`, `atomicLoad`, `atomicFetchAdd`) | ❌ | Not yet |
| Memory barriers / fences | ❌ | Not yet |
| Address-space-qualified pointers (`addrspace`, `mmio`) | ❌ | PoC3 §29.1 — provisional/future |

---

## Section 30–31: Layout, ABI, and Bitfields

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `[Repr(C)]` staged layout annotation | ✅ | Phase 15 closed — staged `[Repr(C)]` source spelling for structs is implemented; HIR/debug docs use repr(C) as the representation concept name; keyword `repr(C)` syntax remains reserved/deferred |
| `repr(packed)` annotation | ❌ | Deferred/unsupported after Phase 15 |
| `align(n)` annotation | ❌ | Not yet |
| `static_assert(sizeof(...) == N)` | ❌ | `static_assert` exists for comptime bool expressions; `sizeof`/`alignof` builtins not yet |
| `bits` type for register definitions | ❌ | PoC3 §31 — not yet |

---

## Section 32: Inline Assembly

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `asm { ... }` inline assembly | ❌ | Not yet |
| `asm volatile { ... }` | ❌ | Not yet |

---

## Section 33: Compile-Time Execution

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `comptime` function declarations | ✅ | Phase 9 — scalar `int`/`bool` functions |
| `comptime expr` call-site evaluation | ✅ | Phase 9 |
| `static_assert(expr)` | ✅ | Phase 9 — evaluates comptime bool expression at compile time |
| Hermetic comptime by default | ✅ | Phase 9 — no host-visible side effects without capability grants |
| `comptime(read_fs, env, ...)` capability annotations | ✅ | Phase 9 — syntax parsed and checked; **no capability is actually granted yet** |
| `target.isLittleEndian` / `target.pointerSize` | ✅ | Phase 9 — deterministic target metadata queries |
| Deterministic fuel-bounded `while` in comptime | ✅ | Phase 9 |
| Comptime `if`/`else` | ✅ | Phase 9 |
| Comptime local mutation | ✅ | Phase 9 |
| Comptime type-level functions (returning types) | ❌ | Not in Phase 9 scope — deferred |
| Comptime reflection (`fieldsOf<T>()`) | ❌ | PoC3 §34 — deferred |
| Host-visible comptime capabilities (actual `read_fs` execution) | ❌ | Annotations exist; execution of capability-gated operations not implemented |

> **Implementation difference:** PoC3 §33.1 describes capability-based comptime permissions as a future-gating mechanism. Phase 9 implements the *annotation and checking* of capabilities but deliberately does not grant any capability yet. The "gremlin stays in the jar." This is a stricter interpretation than PoC3's description suggests, and it's the right call.

---

## Section 34–35: Reflection and Macros

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Compile-time reflection (`fieldsOf<T>`) | ❌ | Deferred — depends on comptime type-level functions |
| Hygienic macro system | ❌ | PoC3 §35 explicitly defers this — correct by design |
| No textual preprocessor | ✅ | By design |

---

## Section 36: C and C++ Interop

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| C backend (compile Concept to C) | ✅ | Phase 4+ — MIR → C backend, primary bootstrap path |
| C-readable generated output | ✅ | Generated C is auditable and readable |
| `extern "C"` declarations | ✅ | Complete for Phase 15 v0 — block-form declarations parse, lower to HIR with ABI/linkage metadata and C symbol names, validate the strict C ABI subset, participate in semantic call resolution, lower extern calls through MIR, emit backend C prototypes/calls with declared C symbols, and reject duplicate C ABI symbols |
| `[Repr(C)]` struct layout | ✅ | Complete for Phase 15 v0 staged syntax — validates supported fields, rejects empty/unsupported/nested-by-value layouts, accepts validated structs and pointers at extern/export C ABI boundaries, emits named typedef structs before use, preserves source field order, and pins ordering/de-duplication |
| Export to C (`export "C"`) | ✅ | Complete for Phase 15 v0 — function definitions parse/lower as ordinary Concept bodies with C linkage metadata, validate C ABI signatures, reject duplicate C symbols, lower through MIR, and emit unmangled C symbols |
| C ABI-compatible type subset | ✅ | Complete for Phase 15 v0 — `void` returns, `int`, current C-backend `bool`/`AllocError` spelling, supported raw pointers, `Arena*`, `Allocator*`, `AllocError*`, validated `[Repr(C)]` structs by value, and pointers to validated `[Repr(C)]` structs; unsupported ABI types are rejected rather than guessed |
| C ABI duplicate symbol checking | ✅ | Phase 15 rejects duplicate extern/export C linkage symbols with pinned diagnostics and fixture coverage |
| C headers/includes | ❌ | Deferred/unsupported — `extern "C"` does not parse headers and backend C does not emit user `#include` lines |
| Automatic linking/linker driver | ❌ | Deferred/unsupported — `export "C"` and `extern "C"` do not imply library selection, linker flags, or a linker driver |
| Varargs | ❌ | Deferred/unsupported; parser rejects `...` in extern C declarations |
| Extern variables | ❌ | Deferred/unsupported |
| C++ interop (`extern "C++"`) | ❌ | PoC3 §36.2 — quarantined/future; unsupported ABI strings are rejected |

---

## Section 37: First-Class State Machines

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `machine Name(params) -> ReturnType { }` declaration | ✅ | Phase 13 |
| `state StateName { }` blocks | ✅ | Phase 13 |
| `transition StateName` literal transitions | ✅ | Phase 13 — runnable, C backend lowered |
| `transition match { ... }` transitions | 🔶 | Phase 13 parsed and HIR-represented this form; Phase 18 plans deterministic runtime lowering with shared-panic no-match failure |
| `transition decide { ... }` transitions | 🔶 | Phase 13 parsed and HIR-represented this form; Phase 18 plans deterministic runtime lowering with int scores, bool guards, source-order tie-breaking, and shared-panic no-enabled-candidate failure |
| `Step(machine)` as statement | ✅ | Phase 13 — statement-like, produces no value |
| `Complete(machine)` returning bool | ✅ | Phase 13 |
| `Result(machine)` returning result type | ✅ | Phase 13 — traps if read before completion |
| `MachineName(args)` construction | ✅ | Phase 13 |
| `noalloc machine` effect checking | ✅ | Phase 13 — `noalloc` effect on machine declaration enforced |
| `yield` statement in machines | ❌ | Deferred from Phase 13 |
| Nested machine fields / child frames | ❌ | Phase 18 P18-M1 audits/hardens the existing local machine frame value model first; by-value zero-parameter child fields and explicit parent `Step`/`Complete`/`Result` remain deferred to P18-M2/P18-M3 |
| Machine lowers to explicit state struct in MIR | ✅ | Phase 13 — state enum and struct visible in MIR |
| Machine lowering visible in MIR (not hidden) | ✅ | Phase 13 |
| References crossing yield restricted | ❌ | Depends on yield being implemented |
| Immovable machine frames | ❌ | Depends on `immovable` being implemented |
| Scalar `int`/`bool` params and results only (Phase 13 v0 constraint) | ✅ | Phase 13 — non-scalar params/results produce clear error |

> **Implementation difference:** PoC3 §37 presents `transition decide` as a core machine primitive alongside `transition`. Phase 13 implements decide-transition *parse and HIR representation* but defers runtime lowering, with a clear error at codegen. The standalone `decide` expression (Phase 5a) is fully runnable — the machine-internal `transition decide` is the deferred variant. This is a deliberate scope decision, not an omission.

## Section 38–39: SoA Layout and Audit Instrumentation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|

## Section 41: Bringup Roadmap Stage Status

| Stage | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Stage 0** | Zig frontend, C backend, basic type checker, test runner | ✅ **Complete** |
| **Stage 1** | Typed HIR→MIR, drop insertion, move checking, use-before-init, must_use, effect checking, match lowering, C backend from MIR | 🔶 **Substantially complete** — see gaps below |
| **Stage 2** | Self-hosting — rewrite compiler in Concept | ❌ Future |
| **Stage 3** | LLVM backend, native backends, optimization | ❌ Future |

**Stage 1 remaining gaps (blocking full Stage 1 completion):**
- remaining `interface` / `dyn` work beyond the borrowed C backend subset:
  owning dyn boxes, dyn returns/fields/locals, RTTI/dynamic cast decisions,
  upcasting/inheritance non-goals, and ABI policy
- repr(C) enums, nested by-value repr(C) fields, packed layout, custom alignment, bitfields, and platform ABI matrices beyond the closed Phase 15 v0 subset
- C headers/includes, automatic linking/linker driver, symbol aliasing, callbacks/function pointers, extern variables, and C++ ABI interop beyond the closed Phase 15 v0 subset
- broader module features beyond Phase 16 v0: visibility, aliases, wildcard imports, re-exports, packages, filesystem lookup/path mapping, module spanning multiple files, separate object files, linker driving, incremental compilation, and cross-package dependency resolution
- `yield` in machines
- Full `must_use` on arbitrary functions (not just enums)
- `panic` / `assert` infrastructure

## Key Implementation Differences vs PoC3 Sketches

1. **`ManualInit<T>` not `MaybeUninit<T>`** — Phase 10 uses `ManualInit<T>` as the canonical name. PoC3 uses `MaybeUninit<T>` in examples, which is treated as compatibility terminology only.

2. **`Arena` and `Allocator` as compiler intrinsics, not library types** — Phase 12 special-cases these rather than implementing a generic `AllocatorLike<T>` concept first. Explicit temporary deviation pending the generic-concept path.

3. **`decide` as a standalone top-level expression (Phase 5a), not only inside machine transitions** — PoC3 §37.6 says utility scoring is "not core" and belongs in libraries. Concept implemented `decide` as a first-class language expression outside machines as a distinct phase 5a feature. Machine-internal `transition decide` is the deferred form. These are separate features.

4. **Capability annotations present but inactive** — Phase 9 capability syntax (`comptime(read_fs, env)`) is parsed and validated but no capability grants are actually executable yet. This is stricter than PoC3 implies.

5. **Testing as `.con_test` files with `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` C#-influenced attributes** — PoC3 §11 leaves the testing model unspecified. Phase 11 chose a xUnit-inspired design with mandatory reason strings, which is not in PoC3.

6. **`transition match` and `transition decide` inside machines fail clearly at backend, not silently** — Phase 13 explicitly defers machine match/decide runtime lowering with clear error messages rather than silently generating wrong code. A deliberate correctness decision.

7. **Manifest format as `concept-manifest-v0` key/value sections** — PoC3 §50 mentions a build manifest as a future document. Phase 11 partially implements a `manifest.zig` parser for a restricted key/value format, not the full declarative subset described in conversations.

*This matrix began as the Phase 13 closeout snapshot and has been updated
through Phase 17 closeout, with Phase 18 P18-M1 machine frame/value audit now complete. Stage 1 is substantially implemented. Phase 14
closed runtime interfaces and borrowed dyn dispatch v0. Phase 15 closed the
single-compilation-unit C ABI v0 surface. Phase 16 closes imports and
multi-module compilation-unit modules v0: harness/driver-supplied multi-file
source sets, module table, import graph, module-aware HIR, per-module ordinary
symbol tables, qualified cross-module functions/types, imported repr(C)
metadata, and multi-source MIR/backend/run in one generated C unit. Remaining
Stage 1 gaps include `yield` in machines, nested machine implementation, runtime transition match/decide implementation, visibility and package/filesystem
module resolution, separate compilation/linker driving, reference/receiver hardening, and broader ABI/layout
features deliberately deferred beyond Phase 15 (repr(C) enums, nested by-value
struct layout, packed/custom alignment, bitfields, headers/includes, automatic
linking, C++ ABI, varargs, extern variables, symbol aliasing, callbacks, and
platform ABI matrices). Phase 17 closes the basic runtime failure substrate, so basic panic, basic runtime assert, shared `cpt_panic`, and machine Result-before-completion trap routing are no longer Stage 1 gaps.*


## Phase 17 M9 closeout update

P17-M9 closes Phase 17. P17-M8 added human-readable examples under `examples/phase17/` and representative fixtures for panic/assert/machine runtime failure behavior. The M8 fixtures pin exit code 101 for panic, false assert, and machine `Result(machine)` before completion; exit 0/ordinary result behavior for true assert and result-after-completion; one-per-C-unit `cpt_panic` helper sharing across panic/assert/migrated machine trap sites; absence of the old `cpt_machine_result_before_complete` helper and `__builtin_trap` at the migrated site; C-escaped reason strings; blank reason rejection; expression-position rejection; bool-only assert conditions; and ordinary runtime assert independence from Core.Test/test-runner symbols. The language fixture corpus now contains 1046 fixture files, including 57 under `language/phase17-runtime-failure/` and 11 under `language/phase18-machines/`.


## Phase 18 M1 update

P18-M1 hardens the machine frame/value baseline before nested fields. It adds 11 fixtures under `language/phase18-machines/` covering local frame construction, explicit stepping, completion/result stability, independent local instances, result-before-completion exit code 101, backend frame shape, shared `cpt_panic` routing, current by-value copy/assignment behavior, and invalid `Step`/`Complete`/`Result` operands. `Step` now requires an assignable machine place and reports `CON0291`; non-machine `Complete` and `Result` report `CON0292` and `CON0293`. Nested machine fields, child initialization, executable transition match, and executable transition decide remain future Phase 18 milestones.

### Phase 18 M2 coverage

Nested machine field coverage now includes HIR preservation, backend by-value child frame fields, deterministic parent-constructor initialization of zero-parameter children, rejection of parameterized child fields with `CON0290`, duplicate child field diagnostics through existing field-name checks, and no hidden heap/scheduler/async backend markers.

### Phase 18 M3 nested machine operation coverage

P18-M3 covers explicit nested machine composition for child fields: `Step(child)` mutates the child frame stored in the parent, `Complete(child)` reads that child completion flag, and `Result(child)` uses the shared result-before-completion panic path. Fixtures also prove that children are not implicitly stepped, multiple child fields compose independently, and runtime `transition match`/`transition decide` remain deferred.

P18-M4 updates `transition match { ... }` coverage from parsed/HIR-only scaffold to executable runtime lowering for the bool subset. Bool scrutinees, including `Complete(child)`, lower through machine step emission to deterministic C `if`/`else` state assignment with exhaustive true/false validation or wildcard default coverage. Non-bool runtime match and `transition decide` remain future work.
